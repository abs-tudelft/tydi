<h1><a class="header" href="#1-introduction" id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Tydi is an open-source project that aims to standardize interfaces for
hardware components used in modern streaming dataflow designs.</p>
<p>The project consists of two parts: the Tydi specification and a set of
reference implementations of useful tools.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#specification" id="specification">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The Tydi (Typed dataflow interface) specification is at the core of the
project: it defines what an interface should look like and constrains its
behavior, based on a constructively defined, low-level data type. Start
reading <a href="./specification/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#tools" id="tools">Tools</a></h2>
<p>Using the Tydi specifications, reference implementations of tools are
implemented and open-sourced.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./tools/generators.html">Generators</a> (under construction)</li>
<li><a href="./tools/compositors.html">Compositors</a> (under construction)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Generators</strong> create HDL templates, that users may fill in with their
desired behavior. Tydi aims to impose <em>no restrictions</em> on what
hardware-description languages are used to work with the specification.
Tydi aims to provide generators for old HDLs, such as VHDL and Verilog,
but also modern HDL</p>
<p><strong>Compositors</strong> are tools that combine streamlets into larger designs.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#tydi-specification" id="tydi-specification">Tydi specification</a></h1>
<p>The Tydi specification, short for Typed dataflow interface specification,
aims to provide a standardized way in which complex data types can be
transferred from one circuit to another, within the context of FPGAs or
ASICs.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-to-read-this-document" id="how-to-read-this-document">How to read this document</a></h2>
<p>The specification is comprised of the following sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="specification/intro.html">Introduction</a>: defines the motivation and scope of this
specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="specification/notation.html">Notation</a>: defines the mathematical notation used by the
remainder of the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="specification/physical.html">Physical stream specification</a>. <strong>Physical streams</strong> are
hardware streams with their own valid/ready handshaking interface,
transporting elementary data and dimensionality information. Their exact
bit-level representation and transfer behavior is defined through five
parameters. These parameters are normally derived from logical streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="specification/logical.html">Logical stream specification</a>. <strong>Logical streams</strong> are bundles
of one or multiple physical streams of some type from the Tydi type system.
Types expressed in this type system determine which physical streams with
which parameters make up the logical stream. This section also introduces
<strong>streamlets</strong>, the Tydi name for components that have logical streams as
inputs and/or outputs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two specification sections are written such that the first paragraph of
each section <em>defines</em> a new concept, and the subsequent paragraphs <em>constrain</em>
it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional information, such as examples, a more intuitive description, or
motivation, is written in these kinds of blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the motivation and scope of the Tydi specification.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#background-and-motivation" id="background-and-motivation">Background and motivation</a></h2>
<p>As FPGAs become faster and larger, they are increasingly used within a
data center context to accelerate computational workloads. FPGAs can already
achieve greater compute density and power efficiency than CPUs and GPUs for
certain types of workloads, particularly those that rely on high streaming
throughput and branch-heavy computation. Examples of this are decompression,
SQL query acceleration, and pattern matching. The major disadvantage of FPGAs
is that they are more difficult to program than CPUs and GPUs, and that
algorithms expressed imperatively in the CPU/GPU domain often need to be
redesigned from the ground up to achieve competitive performance. Both the
advantages and disadvantages are due to the spatial nature of an FPGA: instead
of programming a number of processors, an FPGA designer &quot;programs&quot; millions of
basic computational elements not much more complex than a single logic gate
that all work parallel to each other, and describes how these elements are
interconnected. This extreme programmability comes at a cost of roughly an
order of magnitude in area and an order of magnitude in performance compared
to the custom silicon used to make CPUs and GPUs. Therefore, while imperative
algorithms can indeed be mapped to FPGAs more or less directly through
high-level synthesis (HLS) techniques or the use of softcores, typically an
algorithm needs at least two orders of magnitude of acceleration through clever
use of the spatial nature of the FPGA to be competitive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the industry-standard toolchains needed to program FPGAs only
take VHDL, Verilog, SystemC, (more recently through HLS) a subset of C++,
and/or visually designed data flow graphs as their input. The first three
provide few abstractions above the level of a single wire: while they do allow
the use of data types such as integers and structures to represent bundles of
wires, all control of what the voltages on those bundles of wires represent at
a certain point in time (if anything) remains up to the programmer. The latter
two techniques raise the bar slightly by presenting the designer with streams
and memory. However, they are vendor-specific, often require additional
licensing fees over the more traditional design entry methods, and in some
cases are even specific to a certain version of the vendor tool and/or a
certain FPGA device family.</p>
<p>This situation has given rise to a number of open-source projects that take
higher-level languages and transform them to vendor-agnostic VHDL or Verilog.
Examples of this are <a href="https://www.chisel-lang.org/">Chisel/FIRRTL</a> and
<a href="https://clash-lang.org/">Clash</a>, using generative Scala code and a
Haskell-like functional programming language as their respective inputs. Both
tools come with their own standard libraries of hardware components that can be
used to compose accelerators out of smaller primitives, similar to the data
flow design method described earlier, but with textual input and the advantage
of being vendor and device agnostic.</p>
<p>With the advent of these data flow composition tools, it is increasingly
important to have a common interface standard to allow the primitive blocks to
connect to each other. The de-facto standard for this has become the AMBA AXI4
interface, designed by ARM for their microcontrollers and processors. Roughly
speaking, AXI4 specifies an interface for device-to-memory connections
(<a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0022/d/IHI0022D_amba_axi_protocol_spec.pdf">AXI4 and AXI4-lite</a>),
and a streaming interface
(<a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0051/a/IHI0051A_amba4_axi4_stream_v1_0_protocol_spec.pdf">AXI4-stream</a>)
for intra-device connections.</p>
<p>While AXI4 and AXI4-lite are of primary importance to processors due to their
memory-oriented nature, AXI4-stream is much more important for FPGAs due to
their spatial nature. However, because AXI4-stream is not originally designed
for FPGAs, parts of the specifications are awkward for this purpose. For
instance, AXI4-stream is byte oriented: it requires its data signal to be
divided into one or more byte lanes, and specifies (optional) control signals
that indicate the significance of each lane. Since FPGA designs are not at all
restricted to operating on byte elements, this part of the specification is
often ignored, and as such, any stream with a <code>valid</code>, <code>ready</code>, and one or more
<code>data</code> signals of any width has become the de-facto streaming standard. This is
reflected for instance by Chisel's built-in <code>Decoupled</code> interface type.</p>
<p>Within a single design this is of course not an issue — as long as both the
stream source and sink blocks agree on the same noncompliant interface, the
design will work. However, bearing in mind that there is an increasing number
of independently developed data flow oriented tools, each with their own
standard library, interoperability becomes an issue: whenever a designer needs
to use components from different vendors, they must first ensure that the
interfaces match, and if not, insert the requisite glue logic in between.</p>
<p>A similar issue exists in the software domain, where different programming
languages use different runtime environments and calling conventions. For
instance, efficiently connecting a component written in Java to a component
written in Python requires considerable effort. The keyword here is
&quot;efficiently:&quot; because Java and Python have very different ways of representing
abstract data in memory, one fundamentally has to convert from one
representation to another for any communication between the two components.
This serialization and deserialization overhead can and often does cost more
CPU time than the execution of the algorithms themselves.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> project attempts to solve this
problem by standardizing a way to represent this abstract data in memory, and
providing libraries for popular programming languages to interact with this
data format. The goal is to make transferring data between two processes as
efficient as sharing a pool of Arrow-formatted memory between them. Arrow also
specifies efficient ways of serializing Arrow data structures for (temporary)
storage in files or streaming structures over a network, and can also be used
by GPUs through CUDA. However, FPGA-based acceleration is at the time of
writing missing from the core project. The
<a href="https://github.com/abs-tudelft/fletcher">Fletcher</a> project attempts to bridge
this gap, by providing an interface layer between the Arrow in-memory format
and FPGA accelerators, presenting the memory to the accelerator in an abstract,
tabular form.</p>
<p>In order to represent the complex, nested data types supported by Arrow, the
Fletcher project had to devise its own data streaming format on top of the
de-facto subset of AXI4-stream. Originally, this format was simply a means
to an end, and therefore, not much thought was put into it. Particularly, as
only Arrow-to-device interfaces (and back) were needed for the project, an
interface designed specifically for intra-device streaming is lacking; in
fact, depending on configuration, the reader and writer interfaces do not even
match completely. Clearly, a standard for streaming complex data types between
components is needed, both within the context of the Fletcher project, and
outside of it.</p>
<p>As far as the writers are aware, no such standard exists as of yet. Defining
such a standard in an open, royalty-free way is the primary purpose of this
document.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#goals" id="goals">Goals</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defining a streaming format for complex data types in the context of FPGAs
and, potentially, ASICs, where &quot;complex data types&quot; include:</p>
<ul>
<li>multi-dimensional sequences of undefined length;</li>
<li>unions (a.k.a. variants);</li>
<li>structures such as tuples or records.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing the above in as broad of a way as possible, without imposing
unnecessary burdens on the development of simple components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing for minimization of area and complexity through well-defined
contracts between source and sink on top of the signal specification itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensibility: this specification should be as usable as possible, even to
those with use cases not foreseen by this specification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#non-goals" id="non-goals">Non-goals</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this specification, a &quot;streaming format&quot; refers to the way in which the
voltages on a bundle of wires are used to communicate data. We expressly do
NOT mean streaming over existing communication formats such as Ethernet, and
certainly not over abstract streams such as POSIX pipes or other
inter-process communication paradigms. If you're looking for the former,
have a look at
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/">Arrow Flight</a>.
The latter is part of Apache Arrow itself through their
<a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/ipc.html">IPC format specification</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not intend to compete with the AXI4(-stream) specification.
AXI4-stream is designed for streaming unstructured byte-oriented data;
Tydi streams are for streaming structured, complex data types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tydi streams have no notion of multi-endpoint network-on-chip-like
structures. Adding source and destination addressing or other routing
information can be done through the <code>user</code> signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primitive data type in Tydi is a group of bits. We leave the mapping
from these bits to higher-order types such as numbers, characters, or
timestamps to existing specifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#notation" id="notation">Notation</a></h1>
<p>The Tydi specification uses a flavor of mathematical notation to formally
represent the defined concepts and operations thereupon. The nonstandard part
of this notation is established in this section.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#nodes" id="nodes">Nodes</a></h2>
<p>The structures needed by the specification are complex to the point that
simply using tuples becomes overly confusing. Therefore, we introduce a form
of named tuple, which we will call a node (the term &quot;type&quot; would be more
appropriate, but would be confusing within the context of this specification).</p>
<p>The notation for a node is as follows:</p>
<p>\[\textrm{NodeName}(...)\]</p>
<p>where \(\textrm{NodeName}\) is a title case identifier unique within the
specification, and \(...\) is a number of field names in some pattern. For
example:</p>
<p>\[\textrm{Fields}(N_1 : b_1, N_2 : b_2, ..., N_n : b_n)\]</p>
<p>A node carries with it implicit requirements on what the fields may be.
Whenever an operation constructs a node, the operation is written in a way
that these requirements are guaranteed by the preconditions of the operation.</p>
<p>The field names of nodes are significant. When an operation depends on one of
the fields of the node, the fields may be &quot;accessed&quot; by subscripting the field
name. For instance, if \(F\) is a \(\textrm{Fields}\) node, \(F_n\)
represents the value for \(n\), and \(F_N\) represents the tuple consisting
of \(N_1, N_2, ..., N_n\) of the node.</p>
<p>When the field being indexed is clear from context, the field itself is usually
omitted; for instance, using just \(N\) implies the same thing as \(F_N\)
if there is only one \(\textrm{Fields}\) node being discussed, and nothing
else is using \(N\) for anything.</p>
<p>Nodes may also be unpacked into differently named values using the following
notation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unpack \(F'\) into \(\textrm{Fields}(N'_1 : b'_1, N'_2 : b'_2, ..., N'_n : b'_n)\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following discussion may then use for instance \(N'\) to refer to
\(F'_N\).</p>
<p>In some cases, only some of the fields of a node need to have a certain value
for the following discussion to apply. We will then write only those fields
within the parentheses, prefixing the values with the name and an equals sign,
followed by an ellipsis to signify the unconstrained fields. For example,
\(\textrm{Fields}(n=2, ...)\) signifies a \(\textrm{Fields}\) node with
exactly two \(N\) and two \(b\), but the values thereof are unconstrained.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#functions" id="functions">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Due to the highly generic nature of the specification, parts of it are
described algorithmically. The algorithms are referred to as functions. Like
functions in a typical programming language, they have a signature, written
as follows:</p>
<p>\[\textrm{functionName}(...) \rightarrow \textrm{ReturnType}\]</p>
<p>where \(\textrm{functionName}\) is a camelcase identifier unique within the
specification, \(...\) is a number of argument names in some pattern, and
\(\textrm{ReturnType}\) specifies what is returned, usually in the form of a
node name.</p>
<p>A function carries with it implicit requirements on what its parameters may be.
Whenever an operation uses a function, the operation is written in a way
that these requirements are guaranteed by the preconditions of the operation.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#physical-streams" id="physical-streams">Physical streams</a></h1>
<p>A Tydi physical stream carries a stream of elements, dimensionality information
for said elements, and (optionally) user-defined transfer information from a
source to a sink. The contents of these three groups and to some extent the way
in which they are transferred are defined in a parameterized way, to provide
the necessary flexibility for the higher levels of this specification, and to
give hardware developers the freedom to optimize their designs. Based on these
parameters, this specification defines which signals must exist on the
interface, and the significance of these signals.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#parameters" id="parameters">Parameters</a></h2>
<p>A physical stream is parameterized as \(\textrm{PhysicalStream}(E, N, D, C, U)\).
The significance of these parameters is defined in the following subsections.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The parameters are defined on the interfaces of the source and the sink
rather than the stream between them, because the complexity parameter need
not be the same on the source and sink. The others do.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a class="header" href="#element-content-e-and-usertransfer-content-u" id="element-content-e-and-usertransfer-content-u">Element content (E) and user/transfer content (U)</a></h3>
<p>\(E\) and \(U\) are of the form
\(\textrm{Fields}(N_1 : b_1, N_2 : b_2, ..., N_n : b_n)\), where \(N\) are
names, \(b\) are positive integers representing bit counts, and \(n\) is a
nonnegative integer, describing a list of \(n\) named bit vector signals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The element type can be given zero fields to make a &quot;null&quot; stream. Such
streams can still be useful, as physical streams also carry metadata. The
bit counts are however not allowed to be zero, because a lot of synthesis
tools out there do not handle null ranges very well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference between the element content and the user/transfer content of
a stream, is that a transfer may encode zero or more elements, but always
encodes one instance of the user/transfer content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user/transfer signals are intended for adding lower-level user-defined
protocol signals to the stream, similar to the use of the <code>*USER</code> signals in
AXI4. For instance, physical streams could be transferred over a
network-on-chip-like structure by attaching routing information such as
source and destination addresses through this method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name of each field is a string consisting of letters, numbers, and/or
underscores. It may be empty, represented in this specification as
\(\varnothing\).</p>
<p>The name cannot start or end with an underscore.</p>
<p>The name cannot start with a digit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is illegal to start or end with an underscore or start with a number to
prevent confusion when the name is prefixed to form the signal name, and
for compatibility with VHDL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name must be case-insensitively unique within the set of named fields.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The identifier is case-insensitive because compatibility with VHDL is
desired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\(|\textrm{Fields}(N_1 : b_1, N_2 : b_2, ..., N_n : b_n)|\) is a shorthand
defined to equal \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i\); that is, the sum of the field bit
count over all fields in the element.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#number-of-element-lanes-n" id="number-of-element-lanes-n">Number of element lanes (N)</a></h3>
<p>\(N\) must be an integer greater than or equal to one. The signals used for
describing a data element are replicated this many times, allowing multiple
elements to be transferred per stream handshake. Each replication is called a
lane.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#dimensionality-d" id="dimensionality-d">Dimensionality (D)</a></h3>
<p>\(D\) must be an integer greater than or equal to zero. It specifies the
number of <code>last</code> bits needed to represent the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intuitively, each sequence nesting level adds one to this number. For
instance, to stream two-dimensional sequences, two <code>last</code> bits are needed:
one to mark the boundaries of the inner sequence, and one to mark the
boundary of each two-dimensional sequence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a class="header" href="#complexity-c" id="complexity-c">Complexity (C)</a></h3>
<p>\(C\) must be a nonempty list of nonnegative integers. It encodes the
guarantees a source makes about how elements are transferred. Equivalently,
it encodes the assumptions a sink can safely make.</p>
<blockquote>
<table><thead><tr><th>Higher C</th><th>Lower C</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Fewer guarantees made by source</td><td>More guarantees made by source</td></tr>
<tr><td>Source is easier to implement</td><td>Source is harder to implement</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sink can make fewer assumptions</td><td>Sink can make more assumptions</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sink is harder to implement</td><td>Sink is easier to implement</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>C is usually specified as a period-separated list, like a version number
or paragraph/secion number, because like those things, it is orderable.</p>
<p>The complexity number carries the following intuitive significance.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>\(C\)</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>&lt; 8</td><td>Only one sequence can be terminated per transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt; 7</td><td>The indices of the active data lanes can be described with a simple range.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt; 6</td><td>The range of active data lanes must always start with lane zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt; 5</td><td>All lanes must be active for all but the last transfer of the innermost sequence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt; 4</td><td>The <code>last</code> flag cannot be postponed until after the transfer of the last element.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt; 3</td><td>Innermost sequences must be transferred in consecutive cycles.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt; 2</td><td>Whole outermost instances must be transferred in consecutive cycles.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The exact requirements imposed for each \(C\) can be found along with the
unconditional signal requirements in later sections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complexity levels and signals are defined such that a source with
complexity \(C_a\) can be connected to a sink with complexity
\(C_b \ge C_a\). A complexity number is higher than another when the
leftmost integer of either is greater, and lower when the leftmost integer is
lower. If the leftmost integer is equal, the next integer is checked. If one
complexity number has more entries than another, the shorter number is padded
with zeros on the right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, it works a bit like a version number. The idea behind this is to
allow future version of this specification (or any other kind of addition
later) to insert new complexity levels between the ones defined here. For
instance, 3 &lt; 3.1 &lt; 3.1.1 &lt; 3.2 &lt; 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A stream is considered to be normalized when \(C &lt; 4\). At this complexity
level, there is a one-to-one mapping between the transferred data and the
actual transfers for any given \(N\). This is called the canonical
representation of the data for a given \(N\).</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#clock" id="clock">Clock</a></h3>
<p>All signals are synchronous to a single clock signal, shared between the source
and sink.</p>
<p>It is up to the user to manage clock domains and clock domain crossing where
needed, and specify the edge sensitivity of the clock(s).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reset" id="reset">Reset</a></h3>
<p>This specification places no constraints on the reset signal. The requirements
on the <code>valid</code> and <code>ready</code> signals ensure that no transfers occur when either
the source or the sink is held under reset, so the source, synchronicity, and
sensitivity of the reset signal(s) can be chosen by the user.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#detailed-signal-description" id="detailed-signal-description">Detailed signal description</a></h3>
<h4><a class="header" href="#valid-signal-description" id="valid-signal-description"><code>valid</code> signal description</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>valid</code> signal has the same semantics as the <code>TVALID</code> AXI4-stream signal.
These semantics are repeated here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>valid</code> signal indicates the presence of a valid transfer payload of the
other downstream signals. It is active-high.</p>
<p>The state of the <code>valid</code> signal is always significant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, if the source is in some undefined or &quot;uninitialized&quot; state, <code>valid</code>
<em>must</em> nonetheless be low.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The downstream signals, including <code>valid</code>, must be stable (maintain their
state) from the first active clock edge in which <code>valid</code> is asserted until
acknowledgement of the transfer. Note that the validating and acknowledging
clock edge can be one and the same if <code>ready</code> is already asserted during the
first clock cycle; in this case there are no stability requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, a transfer may not be cancelled or modified after validation.
This allows a sink to start doing some sort of multicycle processing as soon
as <code>valid</code> is asserted, only asserting <code>ready</code> when it is done, without
having to worry about cancellation or changes in the transfer content. This
prevents the need for extra holding registers or latches otherwise needed to
keep the original transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a transfer is acknowledged, either the next transfer is presented on the
downstream signals and <code>valid</code> remains asserted, or <code>valid</code> is released.</p>
<p><em>[\(C &lt; 3\)]</em> <code>valid</code> may only be released when lane \(N - 1\) of the
<code>last</code> signal in the acknowledged transfer is nonzero.</p>
<p><em>[\(C &lt; 2\)]</em> <code>valid</code> may only be released when lane \(N - 1\) of the
<code>last</code> signal in the acknowledged transfer is all ones.</p>
<p><code>valid</code> must be released while the source is being reset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This prevents spurious transfers when the sink has a different reset source.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="header" href="#ready-signal-description" id="ready-signal-description"><code>ready</code> signal description</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>ready</code> signal has the same semantics as the <code>TREADY</code> AXI4-stream signal.

</blockquote>
<p>The <code>ready</code> signal indicates acknowledgement of a transfer initiated through
<code>valid</code>. It is active-high.</p>
<p>The state of the <code>ready</code> signal is significant only while <code>valid</code> is asserted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, a source must never wait for <code>ready</code> to assert before it asserts
<code>valid</code>. Doing so can lead to deadlock. However, a sink <em>may</em> wait for
<code>valid</code> to assert before asserting <code>ready</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A transfer is considered &quot;handshaked&quot; when both <code>valid</code> and <code>ready</code> are
asserted during the active clock edge of the clock domain common to the source
and the sink.</p>
<p><code>ready</code> must be released while the sink is being reset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This prevents transfers from being lost when the source has a different reset
source.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="header" href="#data-signal-description" id="data-signal-description"><code>data</code> signal description</a></h4>
<p>The <code>data</code> signal consists of \(N\) concatenated lanes, each carrying a
number of data element fields, totaling to \(|E|\) bits per lane.</p>
<p>The state of lane \(i\) in the <code>data</code> signal is significant only while
<code>valid</code> is asserted and data lane \(i\) is <em>active</em>. Data lane \(i\) is
considered active if and only if</p>
<ul>
<li>bit \(i\) of <code>strb</code> is asserted,</li>
<li>the unsigned integer interpretation of <code>endi</code> is greater than or equal to
\(i\), <em>and</em></li>
<li>the unsigned integer interpretation of <code>stai</code> is less than or equal to
\(i\).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The redundancy of the <code>endi</code> and <code>stai</code> signals given the presence of the
<code>strb</code> signal (only applicable for \(C \ge 7\)) has to do with the rule
that it must always be possible to connect a source with low complexity to a
sink with high complexity. That is, while a source that desires individual
control over the lanes and thus has \(C \ge 7\) would probably always
drive <code>endi</code> to \(N-1\) and <code>stai</code> to 0, a sink with complexity
\(C \ge 7\) still needs to accept input from sources that do use <code>endi</code>
and <code>stai</code>.</p>
<p>The overhead incurred by this should be negligible in practice. First of all,
because \(C \ge 7\) with significant \(N\) will be quite large to begin
with, so managing two additional signals of size
\(\lceil \log_2{N} \rceil\) probably doesn't matter much. Secondly, in most
cases, constant propagation will remove the unneeded <code>endi</code> and <code>stai</code>
signals whenever both source and sink have \(C \ge 7\). Finally, even if
the above fails, going from <code>stai</code> + <code>endi</code> + <code>strb</code> to the internal lane
enable signals in a sink is trivial for modern FPGAs and realistic \(N\),
as the less-than-equal and greater-than-equal comparisons fit in a single
6-LUT up to and including \(N = 64\), resulting in just three decoding
LUTs per lane (one for <code>stai</code>, one for <code>endi</code>, and one 3-input AND gate to
merge the outputs of the first two and the <code>strb</code> bit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The significant lanes are interpreted in order of increasing index for each
transfer.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#last-signal-description" id="last-signal-description"><code>last</code> signal description</a></h4>
<p>The <code>last</code> signal consists of <code>N</code> concatenated lanes, each carrying a
termination bit for each nested sequence represented by the physical stream.
The <code>last</code> bit for lane \(i\) and dimension \(j\) (i.e., bit
\(i \cdot D + j\)) being asserted indicates completion of a sequence with
nesting level \(D - j - 1\), containing all elements streamed between the
previous lane/transfer this occured for dimension \(j' \ge j\) (or system
reset, if never) exclusively and this point inclusively, where nesting level
is defined to be 0 for the outermost sequence, 1 for its inner sequence, up to
\(D - 1\) for the innermost sequence. It is active-high.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, one way to represent the value
<code>[&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;], [&quot;Tydi&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;], [&quot;&quot;], []</code> with
\(N = 6, C \ge 8\) is as follows. Note that \(D = 2\) follows
from the data type, \(|E|\) depends on the character encoding, and the

dimension 0. The <code>last</code> bit for B3/dimension 1 is also asserted, which
delimits <code>[&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;]</code> along with the reset condition; both the
<code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;World&quot;</code> sequence are fully contained by the delimited
portion of the stream, so the outer sequence has those as its two entries.
<code>&quot;Tydi&quot;</code> is delimited by B3 and C1, <code>&quot;is&quot;</code> by C1 and C3, and <code>&quot;nice&quot;</code> by
C3 and D2 for dimension 0. Note that the D2 is postponed beyond the last

<p>An argument could be made that this encodes <code>[[1, 2], 3, 4], [[5, 6]]</code>, but
allowing this interpretation would make the stream significantly less
type-safe, and there would be no way to encode non-sequence elements before
the last inner sequence in the outer sequence without introducing a <code>start</code>
signal as well.</p>
<p>An argument could also be made that this encodes <code>[[1, 2]], [[3, 4, 5, 6]]</code>,
because the <code>last</code> flag delimiting <code>[1, 2]</code> falls within the first outer

second. However, this would unnecessarily complicate sink logic, make manual
interpretation of the data structure more context-sensitive, and so on.</p>
<p>One could also argue that it encodes <code>[[1, 2]], [[5, 6]]</code>, because <code>3</code> and
<code>4</code> are not enclosed by any inner sequence, but then it makes more sense to
just deactivate the lanes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this representation is ambiguous or at least leads to confusion,
and is therefore illegal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The above rule ultimately means that the <code>last</code> information is transferred on
a transfer basis instead of on element basis, similar to AXI4-stream. This
can significantly decrease decoding complexity, but only allows one innermost
sequence to be transferred per cycle regardless of \(N\) and the length of
the sequence.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#logical-streams" id="logical-streams">Logical streams</a></h1>
<p>A Tydi logical stream consists of a bundle of physical streams and a group of
user-defined signals, parameterized by way of a logical stream type. The
logical stream type, in turn, represents some representation of an abstract
data type (in the same way that for instance <code>std::vector</code> and <code>std::list</code> both
represent a sequence in C++). Conceptually, the resulting logical stream can
then be used to stream instances of its corresponding abstract data type from
the source to the sink. The sink can only receive or operate on one instance at
a time and only in sequence (hence the name &quot;stream&quot;), but the logical stream
type can be designed such that the sink as random-access capability within the
current instance.</p>
<p>Because of the degree of flexibility in specifying Tydi logical streams, much
of this specification consists of the formal definitions of the structures
needed to describe a Tydi logical stream, and operations thereupon. The
resulting constraints on the signal lists and behavior of the signals are then
described based on these.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#logical-stream-type" id="logical-stream-type">Logical stream type</a></h2>
<p>This structure is at the heart of the logical stream specification. It is used
both to specify the type of a logical stream and internally for the process of
lowering the recursive structure down to physical streams and signals.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#structure" id="structure">Structure</a></h3>
<p>The logical stream type is defined recursively by means of a number of node
types. Two classes of nodes are defined: stream-manipulating nodes, and
element-manipulating nodes. Only one stream-manipulating node exists
(\(\textrm{Stream}\)), which is defined in the first subsection. The
remainder of the subsections describe the element-manipulating nodes.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#stream" id="stream">Stream</a></h4>
<p>The \(\textrm{Stream}\) node is used to define a new physical stream. It is
defined as \(\textrm{Stream}(T_e, t, d, s, c, r, T_u, x)\), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>\(T_e\) is any logical stream type, representing the type of element
carried by the logical stream;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This may include additional \(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes to handle cases
such as structures containing sequences, handled in Tydi by transferring
the two different dimensions over two different physical streams, as well
as to encode request-response patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(t\) is a positive real number, representing the minimum number of
elements that should be transferrable on the child stream per element in the
parent stream, or if there is no parent stream, the minimum number of
elements that should be transferrable per clock cycle;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\(t\) is short for throughput ratio. As we'll see later, the \(N\)
parameter for the resulting physical stream equals
\(\left\lceil\prod t\right\rceil\) for all ancestral
\(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes, including this node.</p>
<p>This significance is as follows. Let's say that you have a structure like
\(\textrm{Stream}(T_e = \textrm{Group}(\textrm{a}: \textrm{Bits}(16),
\textrm{b}: \textrm{Stream}(d = 1, T_e = \textrm{Bits}(8), ...)), ...)\),
you're expecting that you'll be transferring about one of those groups
every three cycles, and you're expecting that the list size of <code>b</code> will
be about 8 on average. In this case, \(t = 1/3\) for the outer stream
node, and \(t = 8\) for the inner stream node. That'll give you
\(\lceil 1/3\rceil = 1\) element lane on the outer stream (used at
~33% efficiency) and \(\lceil 1/3 \cdot 8\rceil = 3\) element lanes
for the inner <code>b</code> stream (used at ~88% efficiency), such that neither
stream will on average be slowing down the design.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(d\) is a nonnegative integer, representing the dimensionality of the
child stream with respect to the parent stream;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we'll see later, the \(D\) parameter for the resulting physical
stream equals \(\sum d\) for all ancestral
\(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes, including this node, up to and including the
closest ancestor (or self) for which \(s = \textrm{Flatten}\).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(s\) must be one of \(\textrm{Sync}\), \(\textrm{Flatten}\),
\(\textrm{Desync}\), or \(\textrm{FlatDesync}\), representing the
relation between the dimensionality information of the parent stream and the
child stream;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common relation is \(\textrm{Sync}\), which enforces that for
each element in the parent stream, there must be one \(d\)-dimensional
sequence in the child stream (if \(d\) is 0, that just means one
element). Furthermore, it means that the <code>last</code> flags from the parent
stream are repeated in the child stream.  This repetition is technically
redundant; since the sink will have access to both streams, it only needs
this information once to decode the data.</p>
<p>If this redundant repetition is not necessary for the sink or hard to
generate for a source, \(\textrm{Flatten}\) may be used instead. It is
defined in the same way, except the redundant information is not repeated
for the child stream.</p>
<p>Consider for example the data <code>[(1, [2, 3]), (4, [5])], [(6, [7])]</code>. If
encoded as \(\textrm{Stream}(d=1, T_e=\textrm{Group}(\textrm{Bits}(8), \textrm{Stream}(d=1, s=\textrm{Sync}, ...)), ...)\),
the first physical stream will transfer <code>[1, 4], [6]</code>, and the second
physical stream will transfer <code>[[2, 3], [5]], [[7]]</code>. If
\(\textrm{Flatten}\) is used for the inner \(\textrm{Stream}\)
instead, the data transferred by the second physical stream reduces to
<code>[2, 3], [5], [7]</code>; the structure of the outer sequence is implied by the
structure transferred by the first physical stream.</p>
<p>\(\textrm{Desync}\) may be used if the relation between the elements in
the child and parent stream is dependent on context rather than the <code>last</code>
flags in either stream. For example, for the type
\(\textrm{Stream}(d=1, T_e=\textrm{Group}(\textrm{Bits}(8), \textrm{Stream}(s=\textrm{Desync}, ...)), ...)\),
if the first stream carries <code>[1, 4], [6]</code> as before, the child stream may
carry anything of the form <code>[...], [...]</code>. That is, the dimensionality
information (if any) must still match, but the number of elements in the
innermost sequence is unrelated or only related by some user-defined
context.</p>
<p>\(\textrm{FlatDesync}\), finally, does the same thing as
\(\textrm{Desync}\), but also strips the dimensionality information from
the parent. This means there the relation between the two streams, if any,
is fully user-defined.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(c\) is a complexity number, as defined in the physical stream
specification, representing the complexity for the corresponding physical
stream interface;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(r\) must be one of \(\textrm{Forward}\) or \(\textrm{Reverse}\),
representing the direction of the child stream with respect to the parent
stream, or if there is no parent stream, with respect to the direction of
the logical stream (source to sink);</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\(\textrm{Forward}\) indicates that the child stream flows in the same
direction as its parent, complementing the data of its parent in some way.
Conversely, \(\textrm{Reverse}\) indicates that the child stream acts as
a response channel for the parent stream. If there is no parent stream,
\(\textrm{Forward}\) indicates that the stream flows in the natural
source to sink direction of the logical stream, while
\(\textrm{Reverse}\) indicates a control channel in the opposite
direction. The latter may occur for instance when doing random read access
to a memory; the first stream carrying the read commands then flows in the
sink to source direction.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(T_u\) is a logical stream type consisting of only element-manipulating
nodes, representing the <code>user</code> signals of the physical stream; that is,
transfer-oriented data (versus element-oriented data); and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that while \(T_u\) is called a &quot;logical stream type&quot; for
consistency, the \(\textrm{Stream}\) node being illegal implies that no
additional streams can be specified within this type.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(x\) is a boolean, representing whether the stream carries &quot;extra&quot;
information beyond the <code>data</code> and <code>user</code> signal payloads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\(x\) is normally false, which
implies that the \(\textrm{Stream}\) node will not result in a physical
stream if both its <code>data</code> and <code>user</code> signals would be empty according to
the rest of this specification; it is effectively optimized away. Setting
\(x\) to true simply overrides this behavior.</p>
<p>This optimization handles a fairly common case when the logical stream
type is recursively generated by tooling outside the scope of this layer
of the specification. It arises for instance for nested lists, which may
result in something of the form
\(\textrm{Stream}(d=1, T_e=\textrm{Stream}(d=1, s=\textrm{Sync}, T_e=...))\).
The outer stream is not necessary here; all the dimensionality information
is carried by the inner stream.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the above example should be reduced to
\(\textrm{Stream}(d=2, s=\textrm{Sync}, T_e=...)\) by said external
tool. Indeed, this description is equivalent. This reduction is however
very difficult to define or specify in a way that it handles all cases
intuitively, hence this more pragmatic solution was chosen.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As the \(\textrm{Stream}\) node carries many parameters and can therefore
be hard to read, some abbreviations are in order:</p>
<ul>

&quot;optimized out&quot;), which may still carry dimensionality information, user
data, or even just transfer timing information.</p>

<h4><a class="header" href="#union" id="union">Union</a></h4>
<p>The \(\textrm{Union}\) node acts as a sum type (exclusive disjunction). It
is defined as \(\textrm{Union}(N_1: T_1, N_2: T_2, ..., N_n: T_n)\), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(N_i\) is a string consisting of letters, numbers, and/or underscores,
representing the name of the \(i\)th field;</li>
<li>\(T_i\) is the logical stream type for the \(i\)th field;</li>
<li>\(n\) is a positive integer, representing the number of fields.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Intuitively, each instance of type \(\textrm{Union}\) consists of
an instance of <em>one</em> the contained types (also known as variants), as well
as a tag indicating which field that instance belongs to. This corresponds
to a <code>union</code> or <code>enum</code> in most programming languages. Mathematically, Tydi
unions represent tagged unions.</p>
<p>One might argue that unions could also be specified without the
\(\textrm{Union}\) node, by simply grouping the variants together along
with a manually specified \(\textrm{Bits}\) field for the union tag, and
using don't-cares for the variants not selected through the tag field.
However, there are a number of downsides to such a sparse union approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>For unions with many variants, the <code>data</code> signal of the corresponding
stream becomes very wide.</li>
<li>Any streams nested inside the union variants would need to be stuffed
with don't-care <em>transfers</em> as well, which may result in additional
control logic, delay, area, etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>While such sparse unions have their place, dense unions can be more suitable
for a given application. These could also be represented without a
\(\textrm{Union}\) node, but not in a nicely recursive manner without loss
of information about the variant types. Therefore, (dense) unions were made a
first-class type through \(\textrm{Union}\).</p>
<p>\(\textrm{Union}\)s can also be used to elegantly describe nullable types.
The pattern for that is simply \(\textrm{Union}(\textrm{Null}, T)\). In
this case, the union's tag field acts like a validity bit.</p>

<p>The names cannot contain two or more consecutive underscores.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#union-semantics" id="union-semantics">Union semantics</a></h2>
<p>When flattened into fields, a \(\textrm{Union}\) node consists of:</p>

\(\left\lceil\log_2{n}\right\rceil\), where \(n\) is the number of

</ul>
<p>The <code>&quot;tag&quot;</code> field is used to represent which variant is being represented, by

<p>It is illegal for a source to drive the <code>&quot;tag&quot;</code> field of a \(\textrm{Union}\)
with \(n\) variants to \(n\) or higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The above would otherwise be possible if \(n\) is not a power of two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>&quot;union&quot;</code> field of a \(\textrm{Union}\) is used to represent variant
data existing in the same stream as the union itself. It consists of the
LSB-first, LSB-aligned concatenation of the fields of the variant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No constraint is placed on the value that the source drives on the pad bits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The physical streams represented by \(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes nested inside
\(\textrm{Union}\) variant types behave as if any other variants carried by
the parent stream do not exist, but are otherwise synchronized to the parent
stream as defined by the \(s\) parameter of the child stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the following example, keeping \(x\) generic for now:</p>
<p>\[B = \textrm{Group}(x: \textrm{Bits}(2), y: \textrm{Bits}(2))\\
C = \textrm{Stream}(d=1, s=x, T_e=\textrm{Bits}(4))\\
U = \textrm{Union}(\textrm{a} : \textrm{Bits}(3), \textrm{b} : \textrm{B}, \textrm{c} : C)\\
\textrm{Stream}(d=1, T_e=U)\]</p>
<p>This results in two physical streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>the unnamed stream carrying the union with \(D = 1\), consisting of a
two-bit field named <code>tag</code> and a four-bit field named <code>union</code>; and</li>
<li>a stream named <code>c</code>, consisting of a single unnamed four-bit field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say that we need to represent the data <code>[a:0, b:(x:1, y:2)], [c:[3, 4, 5], a:6]</code>.
The unnamed stream then carries the following four transfers, regardless of
the value for \(x\):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[ (tag: &quot;00&quot;, union: &quot;-000&quot;),     (1)
  (tag: &quot;01&quot;, union: &quot;1001&quot;) ],   (2)
[ (tag: &quot;10&quot;, union: &quot;----&quot;),     (3)
  (tag: &quot;00&quot;, union: &quot;-110&quot;) ]    (4)
</code></pre>
<p>In transfer 1 and 4, the MSB of the <code>union</code> is don't-care, because variant
<code>a</code> uses only three bits. In transfer 2, <code>x</code> is represented by the two LSB
of the <code>union</code> field, while <code>y</code> is represented by the MSBs. Finally, in
transfer 3, all bits of <code>union</code> are don't-care, as stream <code>c</code> is used to
carry the data. Note that a <code>tag</code> value of <code>&quot;11&quot;</code> is illegal in this example.</p>
<p>When \(x = \textrm{Sync}\), stream <code>c</code> has \(D = 2\) and carries the
following transfers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[              ],   (1)
[ [ (&quot;0011&quot;),       (2)
    (&quot;0100&quot;),       (3)
    (&quot;0101&quot;) ] ]    (4)
</code></pre>
<p>Transfer 1 carries an empty outer sequence, corresponding to
<code>[a:0, b:(x:1, y:2)]</code> of the represented data. There are no inner sequences
because variant <code>c</code> never occurs in the first sequence, but the outer
sequence must still be represented to correctly copy the dimensionality
information of the parent stream, as mandated by the \(\textrm{Sync}\) tag.
The second outer sequence represents <code>[c:[3, 4, 5], a:6]</code>; it carries one
inner sequence, because variant <code>c</code> occurs once. The inner sequence directly
corresponds to <code>[3, 4, 5]</code>.</p>
<p>When \(x = \textrm{Flatten}\), the outer sequence is flattened away.
Therefore, stream <code>c</code> has \(D = 1\) and carries only the following
transfers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[ (&quot;0011&quot;),     (1)
  (&quot;0100&quot;),     (2)
  (&quot;0101&quot;) ]    (3)
</code></pre>
<p>It is then up to the sink to recover the outer dimension if it needs it.</p>
<p>When \(x = \textrm{Desync}\), \(D = 2\) as before. For the example data,
the transfers would be exactly the same as for \(x = \textrm{Sync}\), but
the zero-or-more relationship defined by the \(\textrm{Desync}\) means that
a <code>c</code> variant in the parent stream may correspond with any number of inner
sequences on the <code>c</code> stream. That does however still mean that the first
outer sequence must be empty, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[         ],
[ [ ... ]
    ...
  [ ... ] ]
</code></pre>
<p>After all, there are no <code>c</code> variants in the first sequence to apply the
zero-or-more relationship to.</p>
<p>Finally, \(x = \textrm{FlatDesync}\) flattens the outer sequence away
compared to \(x = \textrm{Desync}\), allowing for any number of transfers
to occur on the <code>c</code> stream, all corresponding to the <code>c</code> variant in transfer
3 of the parent stream.</p>
<p>If you're confused as to how a sink is to determine which transfers on the
<code>c</code> stream correspond to which <code>c</code> variant in the parent stream, recall that
the purpose of \(\textrm{Desync}\) and \(\textrm{FlatDesync}\) is to
allow the user of this layer of the specification to define this relation as
they see fit. Usually, a pattern of the form
\(\textrm{Group}(\textrm{len}: \textrm{Bits}(...), \textrm{data}: \textrm{Stream}(s=\textrm{Desync}, ...))\)
would be used, in which case the length of the encoded inner sequence would
be transferred using the <code>union</code> field of the parent stream.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#natural-ordering-and-inter-stream-dependencies" id="natural-ordering-and-inter-stream-dependencies">Natural ordering and inter-stream dependencies</a></h2>

<p>This corresponds to depth-first preorder traversal of the logical stream type

</blockquote>
<p>Sources may not assume that sinks will be able to handshake data in an order
differing from the natural order defined above.</p>
<p>Sinks may not assume that sources will be able to handshake data in an order
differing from the natural order defined above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The above two rules, if adhered to by both source and sink, prevent
inter-physical-stream deadlocks.</p>
<p>Consider the following simple example:</p>
<p>\[C = \textrm{Stream}(s = \textrm{Sync}, d = 0, ...)\\
\textrm{Group}(\textrm{a}: C, \textrm{b}: C)\]</p>
<p><code>[(a: 1, b: 2), (a: 3, b: 4)]</code></p>
<p>Let's say the source follows the natural ordering rule and can't buffer
anything. That is, it drives <code>1</code> on physical stream <code>a</code>, waits for the
transfer to be acknowledged before driving <code>2</code> on physical stream <code>b</code>, then
waits for that to be acknowledged before driving <code>3</code>, and so on. If the
natural-ordering rule for sinks did not exist, the sink may try to wait for
stream <code>b</code> to be validated before it will acknowledge <code>a</code>, which would in
this case cause a deadlock.</p>
<p>The reasoning also works the other way around. That is, if a sink will only
acknowledge in the natural order, but the source is allowed to drive <code>2</code> on
<code>b</code> and wait for its acknowledgement before driving <code>1</code> on <code>a</code>, a similar
deadlock will occur.</p>
<p>The above does <em>not</em> mean that a source isn't allowed to drive data on the
two streams independently as fast as it can. The same thing goes for
acknowledgement by a sink. If both source and sink support full out-of-order
transferral of both streams, the elements can be transferred in any order.
It just means that sources and sinks must be compatible with an opposite end
that does not support out-of-order transferral.</p>
<p>The above reasoning is particularly important for streams flowing in opposing
directions. In this case, for a physical stream <code>x</code> naturally-ordered before
another stream <code>y</code> flowing in the opposing direction, <code>x</code> acts as a request
stream and <code>y</code> acts as its response. That is, the source of <code>x</code> may not
assume that the response will come before it sends the request.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#user-defined-signal-constraints" id="user-defined-signal-constraints">User-defined signal constraints</a></h2>
<p>Tydi places the following constraints on the user-defined signals.</p>
<p>The user-defined signals flow exclusively in the source to sink direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While physical streams can be reversed in order to transfer metadata in the
sink to source direction, logical streams fundamentally describe dataflow in
the source to sink direction. Therefore, if data needs to flow in the
opposite direction as well, you should use a second logical stream.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this design choice is mostly practical in nature.
Firstly, with the way the logical stream type is currently defined,
unidirectional signals emerge naturally before the first stream node is
opened, but reverse-direction signals do not. Therefore, additional nodes
would be needed to describe this. Secondly, allowing signals to flow in both
directions might be interpreted by users as a way for them to implement their
own handshake method to use instead of or in addition to the handshakes of
the Tydi physical streams. Most handshake methods break however when
registers or clock domain crossings not specifically tailored for that
particular handshake are inserted in between. With a purely unidirectional
approach, latency bounds are not necessary for correctness, allowing tooling
to automatically generate interconnect IP. Tydi does pose some constraints
on such IP, however.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interconnect components such as register slices and clock domain crossings may
interpret the signals as being asynchronous. Thus, a sink may not rely upon bit
flips driven in the same cycle by the source from occurring in the same cycle
at the sink.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This allows clock domain crossings for the user-defined signals to reduce to
simple synchronization registers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latency of any signal travelling from source to sink must be less than or
equal to the latency of the streams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This allows the user-defined signals to be used as a way to transfer
quasi-constant values, such as the control register inputs for some kernel.
As long as the constants are only mutated before the source sends the first
stream transfer, the signals received by the sink are guaranteed to be stable
by the time it receives the first transfer.</p>
<p>Handshaking in the reverse direction may be done using a reversed stream.
When the sink is done processing, it sends a transfer on this stream. This
will necessarily be received by the source at a later point in time, which
is then free to modify the user signals again.</p>
<p>Note that slow-changing counter values (those that only increment or
decrement slowly with respect to the involved clock domains) can be
safely transferred using Gray code. Pulse/strobe signals can be safely
transferred by the source toggling a user-defined signal whenever the
strobe occurs, and the sink detecting the transitions in this signal.</p>
