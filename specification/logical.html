                        <h1><a class="header" href="#logical-streams" id="logical-streams">Logical streams</a></h1>
<p>A Tydi logical stream consists of a bundle of physical streams and a group of
user-defined signals, parameterized by way of a logical stream type. The
logical stream type, in turn, represents some representation of an abstract
data type (in the same way that for instance <code>std::vector</code> and <code>std::list</code> both
represent a sequence in C++). Conceptually, the resulting logical stream can
then be used to stream instances of its corresponding abstract data type from
the source to the sink. The sink can only receive or operate on one instance at
a time and only in sequence (hence the name &quot;stream&quot;), but the logical stream
type can be designed such that the sink as random-access capability within the
current instance.</p>
<p>Because of the degree of flexibility in specifying Tydi logical streams, much
of this specification consists of the formal definitions of the structures
needed to describe a Tydi logical stream, and operations thereupon. The
resulting constraints on the signal lists and behavior of the signals are then
described based on these.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#logical-stream-type" id="logical-stream-type">Logical stream type</a></h2>
<p>This structure is at the heart of the logical stream specification. It is used
both to specify the type of a logical stream and internally for the process of
lowering the recursive structure down to physical streams and signals.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#structure" id="structure">Structure</a></h3>
<p>The logical stream type is defined recursively by means of a number of node
types. Two classes of nodes are defined: stream-manipulating nodes, and
element-manipulating nodes. Only one stream-manipulating node exists
(\(\textrm{Stream}\)), which is defined in the first subsection. The
remainder of the subsections describe the element-manipulating nodes.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#stream" id="stream">Stream</a></h4>
<p>The \(\textrm{Stream}\) node is used to define a new physical stream. It is
defined as \(\textrm{Stream}(T_e, t, d, s, c, r, T_u, x)\), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>\(T_e\) is any logical stream type, representing the type of element
carried by the logical stream;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This may include additional \(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes to handle cases
such as structures containing sequences, handled in Tydi by transferring
the two different dimensions over two different physical streams, as well
as to encode request-response patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(t\) is a positive real number, representing the minimum number of
elements that should be transferrable on the child stream per element in the
parent stream, or if there is no parent stream, the minimum number of
elements that should be transferrable per clock cycle;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\(t\) is short for throughput ratio. As we'll see later, the \(N\)
parameter for the resulting physical stream equals
\(\left\lceil\prod t\right\rceil\) for all ancestral
\(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes, including this node.</p>
<p>This significance is as follows. Let's say that you have a structure like
\(\textrm{Stream}(T_e = \textrm{Group}(\textrm{a}: \textrm{Bits}(16),
\textrm{b}: \textrm{Stream}(d = 1, T_e = \textrm{Bits}(8), ...)), ...)\),
you're expecting that you'll be transferring about one of those groups
every three cycles, and you're expecting that the list size of <code>b</code> will
be about 8 on average. In this case, \(t = 1/3\) for the outer stream
node, and \(t = 8\) for the inner stream node. That'll give you
\(\lceil 1/3\rceil = 1\) element lane on the outer stream (used at
~33% efficiency) and \(\lceil 1/3 \cdot 8\rceil = 3\) element lanes
for the inner <code>b</code> stream (used at ~88% efficiency), such that neither
stream will on average be slowing down the design.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(d\) is a nonnegative integer, representing the dimensionality of the
child stream with respect to the parent stream;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we'll see later, the \(D\) parameter for the resulting physical
stream equals \(\sum d\) for all ancestral
\(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes, including this node, up to and including the
closest ancestor (or self) for which \(s = \textrm{Flatten}\).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(s\) must be one of \(\textrm{Sync}\), \(\textrm{Flatten}\),
\(\textrm{Desync}\), or \(\textrm{FlatDesync}\), representing the
relation between the dimensionality information of the parent stream and the
child stream;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common relation is \(\textrm{Sync}\), which enforces that for
each element in the parent stream, there must be one \(d\)-dimensional
sequence in the child stream (if \(d\) is 0, that just means one
element). Furthermore, it means that the <code>last</code> flags from the parent
stream are repeated in the child stream.  This repetition is technically
redundant; since the sink will have access to both streams, it only needs
this information once to decode the data.</p>
<p>If this redundant repetition is not necessary for the sink or hard to
generate for a source, \(\textrm{Flatten}\) may be used instead. It is
defined in the same way, except the redundant information is not repeated
for the child stream.</p>
<p>Consider for example the data <code>[(1, [2, 3]), (4, [5])], [(6, [7])]</code>. If
encoded as \(\textrm{Stream}(d=1, T_e=\textrm{Group}(\textrm{Bits}(8), \textrm{Stream}(d=1, s=\textrm{Sync}, ...)), ...)\),
the first physical stream will transfer <code>[1, 4], [6]</code>, and the second
physical stream will transfer <code>[[2, 3], [5]], [[7]]</code>. If
\(\textrm{Flatten}\) is used for the inner \(\textrm{Stream}\)
instead, the data transferred by the second physical stream reduces to
<code>[2, 3], [5], [7]</code>; the structure of the outer sequence is implied by the
structure transferred by the first physical stream.</p>
<p>\(\textrm{Desync}\) may be used if the relation between the elements in
the child and parent stream is dependent on context rather than the <code>last</code>
flags in either stream. For example, for the type
\(\textrm{Stream}(d=1, T_e=\textrm{Group}(\textrm{Bits}(8), \textrm{Stream}(s=\textrm{Desync}, ...)), ...)\),
if the first stream carries <code>[1, 4], [6]</code> as before, the child stream may
carry anything of the form <code>[...], [...]</code>. That is, the dimensionality
information (if any) must still match, but the number of elements in the
innermost sequence is unrelated or only related by some user-defined
context.</p>
<p>\(\textrm{FlatDesync}\), finally, does the same thing as
\(\textrm{Desync}\), but also strips the dimensionality information from
the parent. This means there the relation between the two streams, if any,
is fully user-defined.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(c\) is a complexity number, as defined in the physical stream
specification, representing the complexity for the corresponding physical
stream interface;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(r\) must be one of \(\textrm{Forward}\) or \(\textrm{Reverse}\),
representing the direction of the child stream with respect to the parent
stream, or if there is no parent stream, with respect to the direction of
the logical stream (source to sink);</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\(\textrm{Forward}\) indicates that the child stream flows in the same
direction as its parent, complementing the data of its parent in some way.
Conversely, \(\textrm{Reverse}\) indicates that the child stream acts as
a response channel for the parent stream. If there is no parent stream,
\(\textrm{Forward}\) indicates that the stream flows in the natural
source to sink direction of the logical stream, while
\(\textrm{Reverse}\) indicates a control channel in the opposite
direction. The latter may occur for instance when doing random read access
to a memory; the first stream carrying the read commands then flows in the
sink to source direction.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(T_u\) is a logical stream type consisting of only element-manipulating
nodes, representing the <code>user</code> signals of the physical stream; that is,
transfer-oriented data (versus element-oriented data); and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that while \(T_u\) is called a &quot;logical stream type&quot; for
consistency, the \(\textrm{Stream}\) node being illegal implies that no
additional streams can be specified within this type.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(x\) is a boolean, representing whether the stream carries &quot;extra&quot;
information beyond the <code>data</code> and <code>user</code> signal payloads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\(x\) is normally false, which
implies that the \(\textrm{Stream}\) node will not result in a physical
stream if both its <code>data</code> and <code>user</code> signals would be empty according to
the rest of this specification; it is effectively optimized away. Setting
\(x\) to true simply overrides this behavior.</p>
<p>This optimization handles a fairly common case when the logical stream
type is recursively generated by tooling outside the scope of this layer
of the specification. It arises for instance for nested lists, which may
result in something of the form
\(\textrm{Stream}(d=1, T_e=\textrm{Stream}(d=1, s=\textrm{Sync}, T_e=...))\).
The outer stream is not necessary here; all the dimensionality information
is carried by the inner stream.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the above example should be reduced to
\(\textrm{Stream}(d=2, s=\textrm{Sync}, T_e=...)\) by said external
tool. Indeed, this description is equivalent. This reduction is however
very difficult to define or specify in a way that it handles all cases
intuitively, hence this more pragmatic solution was chosen.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As the \(\textrm{Stream}\) node carries many parameters and can therefore
be hard to read, some abbreviations are in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\textrm{Dim}(T_e, t, c, T_u) \ \rightarrow\ \textrm{Stream}(T_e, t, 1, \textrm{Sync},    c, \textrm{Forward}, T_u, \textrm{false})\)</li>
<li>\(\textrm{New}(T_e, t, c, T_u) \ \rightarrow\ \textrm{Stream}(T_e, t, 0, \textrm{Sync},    c, \textrm{Forward}, T_u, \textrm{false})\)</li>
<li>\(\textrm{Des}(T_e, t, c, T_u) \ \rightarrow\ \textrm{Stream}(T_e, t, 0, \textrm{Desync},  c, \textrm{Forward}, T_u, \textrm{false})\)</li>
<li>\(\textrm{Flat}(T_e, t, c, T_u)\ \rightarrow\ \textrm{Stream}(T_e, t, 0, \textrm{Flatten}, c, \textrm{Forward}, T_u, \textrm{false})\)</li>
<li>\(\textrm{Rev}(T_e, t, c, T_u) \ \rightarrow\ \textrm{Stream}(T_e, t, 0, \textrm{Sync},    c, \textrm{Reverse}, T_u, \textrm{false})\)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the above abbreviations, the following defaults apply in addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(T_u = \textrm{Null}\);</li>
<li>\(c =\) complexity of parent stream (cannot be omitted if there is no
parent);</li>
<li>\(t = 1\).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="header" href="#null" id="null">Null</a></h4>
<p>The \(\textrm{Null}\) leaf node indicates the transferrence of one-valued
data: it is only valid value is \(\varnothing\) (null).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is useful primarily when used within a \(\textrm{Union}\), where the
data type itself carries information. Furthermore, \(\textrm{Stream}\)
nodes carrying a \(\textrm{Null}\) will always result in a physical stream
(whereas \(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes carrying only other streams will be
&quot;optimized out&quot;), which may still carry dimensionality information, user
data, or even just transfer timing information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="header" href="#bits" id="bits">Bits</a></h4>
<p>The \(\textrm{Bits}\) leaf node, defined as \(\textrm{Bits}(b)\), indicates
the transferrence of \(2^b\)-valued data carried by means of a group of
\(b\) bits, where \(b\) is a positive integer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tydi does not specify how the bits should be interpreted: such interpretation
is explicitly out of scope.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="header" href="#group" id="group">Group</a></h4>
<p>The \(\textrm{Group}\) node acts as a product type (composition). It is
defined as \(\textrm{Group}(N_1: T_1, N_2: T_2, ..., N_n: T_n)\), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(N_i\) is a string consisting of letters, numbers, and/or underscores,
representing the name of the \(i\)th field;</li>
<li>\(T_i\) is the logical stream type for the \(i\)th field;</li>
<li>\(n\) is a nonnegative integer, representing the number of fields.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Intuitively, each instance of type \(\textrm{Group}(...)\) consists of
instances of <em>all</em> the contained types. This corresponds to a <code>struct</code> or
<code>record</code> in most programming languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The names cannot contain two or more consecutive underscores.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Double underscores are used by Tydi as a hierarchy separator when flattening

<h4><a class="header" href="#union" id="union">Union</a></h4>
<p>The \(\textrm{Union}\) node acts as a sum type (exclusive disjunction). It
is defined as \(\textrm{Union}(N_1: T_1, N_2: T_2, ..., N_n: T_n)\), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(N_i\) is a string consisting of letters, numbers, and/or underscores,
representing the name of the \(i\)th field;</li>
<li>\(T_i\) is the logical stream type for the \(i\)th field;</li>
<li>\(n\) is a positive integer, representing the number of fields.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Intuitively, each instance of type \(\textrm{Union}\) consists of
an instance of <em>one</em> the contained types (also known as variants), as well
as a tag indicating which field that instance belongs to. This corresponds
to a <code>union</code> or <code>enum</code> in most programming languages. Mathematically, Tydi
unions represent tagged unions.</p>
<p>One might argue that unions could also be specified without the
\(\textrm{Union}\) node, by simply grouping the variants together along
with a manually specified \(\textrm{Bits}\) field for the union tag, and
using don't-cares for the variants not selected through the tag field.
However, there are a number of downsides to such a sparse union approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>For unions with many variants, the <code>data</code> signal of the corresponding
stream becomes very wide.</li>
<li>Any streams nested inside the union variants would need to be stuffed
with don't-care <em>transfers</em> as well, which may result in additional
control logic, delay, area, etc..</li>
</ul>
<p>While such sparse unions have their place, dense unions can be more suitable
for a given application. These could also be represented without a
\(\textrm{Union}\) node, but not in a nicely recursive manner without loss
of information about the variant types. Therefore, (dense) unions were made a
first-class type through \(\textrm{Union}\).</p>
<p>\(\textrm{Union}\)s can also be used to elegantly describe nullable types.
The pattern for that is simply \(\textrm{Union}(\textrm{Null}, T)\). In
this case, the union's tag field acts like a validity bit.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#union-semantics" id="union-semantics">Union semantics</a></h2>

<p>It is illegal for a source to drive the <code>&quot;tag&quot;</code> field of a \(\textrm{Union}\)
with \(n\) variants to \(n\) or higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The above would otherwise be possible if \(n\) is not a power of two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>&quot;union&quot;</code> field of a \(\textrm{Union}\) is used to represent variant
data existing in the same stream as the union itself. It consists of the
LSB-first, LSB-aligned concatenation of the fields of the variant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No constraint is placed on the value that the source drives on the pad bits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The physical streams represented by \(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes nested inside
\(\textrm{Union}\) variant types behave as if any other variants carried by
the parent stream do not exist, but are otherwise synchronized to the parent
stream as defined by the \(s\) parameter of the child stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the following example, keeping \(x\) generic for now:</p>
<p>\[B = \textrm{Group}(x: \textrm{Bits}(2), y: \textrm{Bits}(2))\\
C = \textrm{Stream}(d=1, s=x, T_e=\textrm{Bits}(4))\\
U = \textrm{Union}(\textrm{a} : \textrm{Bits}(3), \textrm{b} : \textrm{Bits}(3), \textrm{c} : C)\\
\textrm{Stream}(d=1, T_e=U)\]</p>
<p>This results in two physical streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>the unnamed stream carrying the union with \(D = 1\), consisting of a
two-bit field named <code>tag</code> and a four-bit field named <code>union</code>; and</li>
<li>a stream named <code>c</code>, consisting of a single unnamed four-bit field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say that we need to represent the data <code>[a:0, b:(x:1, y:2)], [c:[3, 4, 5], a:6]</code>.
The unnamed stream then carries the following four transfers, regardless of
the value for \(x\):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[ (tag: &quot;00&quot;, union: &quot;-000&quot;),     (1)
  (tag: &quot;01&quot;, union: &quot;1001&quot;) ],   (2)
[ (tag: &quot;10&quot;, union: &quot;----&quot;),     (3)
  (tag: &quot;00&quot;, union: &quot;-110&quot;) ]    (4)
</code></pre>
<p>In transfer 1 and 4, the MSB of the <code>union</code> is don't-care, because variant
<code>a</code> uses only three bits. In transfer 2, <code>x</code> is represented by the two LSB
of the <code>union</code> field, while <code>y</code> is represented by the MSBs. Finally, in
transfer 3, all bits of <code>union</code> are don't-care, as stream <code>c</code> is used to
carry the data. Note that a <code>tag</code> value of <code>&quot;11&quot;</code> is illegal in this example.</p>
<p>When \(x = \textrm{Sync}\), stream <code>c</code> has \(D = 2\) and carries the
following transfers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[              ],   (1)
[ [ (&quot;0011&quot;),       (2)
    (&quot;0100&quot;),       (3)
    (&quot;0101&quot;) ] ]    (4)
</code></pre>
<p>Transfer 1 carries an empty outer sequence, corresponding to
<code>[a:0, b:(x:1, y:2)]</code> of the represented data. There are no inner sequences
because variant <code>c</code> never occurs in the first sequence, but the outer
sequence must still be represented to correctly copy the dimensionality
information of the parent stream, as mandated by the \(\textrm{Sync}\) tag.
The second outer sequence represents <code>[c:[3, 4, 5], a:6]</code>; it carries one
inner sequence, because variant <code>c</code> occurs once. The inner sequence directly
corresponds to <code>[3, 4, 5]</code>.</p>
<p>When \(x = \textrm{Flatten}\), the outer sequence is flattened away.
Therefore, stream <code>c</code> has \(D = 1\) and carries only the following
transfers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[ (&quot;0011&quot;),     (1)
  (&quot;0100&quot;),     (2)
  (&quot;0101&quot;) ]    (3)
</code></pre>
<p>It is then up to the sink to recover the outer dimension if it needs it.</p>
<p>When \(x = \textrm{Desync}\), \(D = 2\) as before. For the example data,
the transfers would be exactly the same as for \(x = \textrm{Sync}\), but
the zero-or-more relationship defined by the \(\textrm{Desync}\) means that
a <code>c</code> variant in the parent stream may correspond with any number of inner
sequences on the <code>c</code> stream. That does however still mean that the first
outer sequence must be empty, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[         ],
[ [ ... ]
    ...
  [ ... ] ]
</code></pre>
<p>After all, there are no <code>c</code> variants in the first sequence to apply the
zero-or-more relationship to.</p>
<p>Finally, \(x = \textrm{FlatDesync}\) flattens the outer sequence away
compared to \(x = \textrm{Desync}\), allowing for any number of transfers
to occur on the <code>c</code> stream, all corresponding to the <code>c</code> variant in transfer
3 of the parent stream.</p>
<p>If you're confused as to how a sink is to determine which transfers on the
<code>c</code> stream correspond to which <code>c</code> variant in the parent stream, recall that
the purpose of \(\textrm{Desync}\) and \(\textrm{FlatDesync}\) is to
allow the user of this layer of the specification to define this relation as
they see fit. Usually, a pattern of the form
\(\textrm{Group}(\textrm{len}: \textrm{Bits}(...), \textrm{data}: \textrm{Stream}(s=\textrm{Desync}, ...))\)
would be used, in which case the length of the encoded inner sequence would
be transferred using the <code>union</code> field of the parent stream.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#natural-ordering-and-inter-stream-dependencies" id="natural-ordering-and-inter-stream-dependencies">Natural ordering and inter-stream dependencies</a></h2>
<p>The natural ordering of a datum transferred over a logical stream is defined
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>for \(\textrm{Group}\) nodes, the elements are ordered by left-to-right
group order; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for \(\textrm{Stream}\) nodes with a parent stream, for every element
transferred on the parent stream, transfer the parent element first, then
transfer the corresponding data on the child stream. This data depends on
the \(s\) and \(d\) parameters of the \(\textrm{Stream}\) node:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(s \in (\textrm{Sync}, \textrm{Flatten})\), \(d = 0\): one element
on the parent stream corresponds to one element on the child stream;</li>
<li>\(s = \textrm{Sync}\), \(d &gt; 0\): one element on the parent stream
corresponds to one \(d\)-dimensional sequence on the child stream,
delimited by the most significant <code>last</code> bit added on top of the <code>last</code>
bits replicated from the parent stream;</li>
<li>\(s = \textrm{Flatten}\), \(d &gt; 0\): one element on the parent stream
corresponds to one \(d\)-dimensional sequence on the child stream,
delimited by the most significant <code>last</code> bit;</li>
<li>\(s \in (\textrm{Desync}, \textrm{FlatDesync})\), \(d = 0\): one
element on the parent stream corresponds to a user/context-defined number
of elements on the child stream (zero or more); and</li>
<li>\(s \in (\textrm{Desync}, \textrm{FlatDesync})\), \(d &gt; 0\): one
element on the parent stream corresponds to a user/context-defined number
of \(d\)-dimensional sequences on the child stream (zero or more).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Sources may not assume that sinks will be able to handshake data in an order
differing from the natural order defined above.</p>
<p>Sinks may not assume that sources will be able to handshake data in an order
differing from the natural order defined above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The above two rules, if adhered to by both source and sink, prevent
inter-physical-stream deadlocks.</p>
<p>Consider the following simple example:</p>
<p>\[C = \textrm{Stream}(s = \textrm{Sync}, d = 0, ...)\\
\textrm{Group}(\textrm{a}: C, \textrm{b}: C)\]</p>
<p><code>[(a: 1, b: 2), (a: 3, b: 4)]</code></p>
<p>Let's say the source follows the natural ordering rule and can't buffer
anything. That is, it drives <code>1</code> on physical stream <code>a</code>, waits for the
transfer to be acknowledged before driving <code>2</code> on physical stream <code>b</code>, then
waits for that to be acknowledged before driving <code>3</code>, and so on. If the
natural-ordering rule for sinks did not exist, the sink may try to wait for
stream <code>b</code> to be validated before it will acknowledge <code>a</code>, which would in
this case cause a deadlock.</p>
<p>The reasoning also works the other way around. That is, if a sink will only
acknowledge in the natural order, but the source is allowed to drive <code>2</code> on
<code>b</code> and wait for its acknowledgement before driving <code>1</code> on <code>a</code>, a similar
deadlock will occur.</p>
<p>The above does <em>not</em> mean that a source isn't allowed to drive data on the
two streams independently as fast as it can. The same thing goes for
acknowledgement by a sink. If both source and sink support full out-of-order
transferral of both streams, the elements can be transferred in any order.
It just means that sources and sinks must be compatible with an opposite end
that does not support out-of-order transferral.</p>
<p>The above reasoning is particularly important for streams flowing in opposing
directions. In this case, for a physical stream <code>x</code> naturally-ordered before
another stream <code>y</code> flowing in the opposing direction, <code>x</code> acts as a request
stream and <code>y</code> acts as its response. That is, the source of <code>x</code> may not
assume that the response will come before it sends the request.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#user-defined-signal-constraints" id="user-defined-signal-constraints">User-defined signal constraints</a></h2>
<p>Tydi places the following constraints on the user-defined signals.</p>
<p>The user-defined signals flow exclusively in the source to sink direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While physical streams can be reversed in order to transfer metadata in the
sink to source direction, logical streams fundamentally describe dataflow in
the source to sink direction. Therefore, if data needs to flow in the
opposite direction as well, you should use a second logical stream.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this design choice is mostly practical in nature.
Firstly, with the way the logical stream type is currently defined,
unidirectional signals emerge naturally before the first stream node is
opened, but reverse-direction signals do not. Therefore, additional nodes
would be needed to describe this. Secondly, allowing signals to flow in both
directions might be interpreted by users as a way for them to implement their
own handshake method to use instead of or in addition to the handshakes of
the Tydi physical streams. Most handshake methods break however when
registers or clock domain crossings not specifically tailored for that
particular handshake are inserted in between. With a purely unidirectional
approach, latency bounds are not necessary for correctness, allowing tooling
to automatically generate interconnect IP. Tydi does pose some constraints
on such IP, however.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interconnect components such as register slices and clock domain crossings may
interpret the signals as being asynchronous. Thus, a sink may not rely upon bit
flips driven in the same cycle by the source from occurring in the same cycle
at the sink.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This allows clock domain crossings for the user-defined signals to reduce to
simple synchronization registers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latency of any signal travelling from source to sink must be less than or
equal to the latency of the streams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This allows the user-defined signals to be used as a way to transfer
quasi-constant values, such as the control register inputs for some kernel.
As long as the constants are only mutated before the source sends the first
stream transfer, the signals received by the sink are guaranteed to be stable
by the time it receives the first transfer.</p>
<p>Handshaking in the reverse direction may be done using a reversed stream.
When the sink is done processing, it sends a transfer on this stream. This
will necessarily be received by the source at a later point in time, which
is then free to modify the user signals again.</p>
<p>Note that slow-changing counter values (those that only increment or
decrement slowly with respect to the involved clock domains) can be
safely transferred using Gray code. Pulse/strobe signals can be safely
transferred by the source toggling a user-defined signal whenever the
strobe occurs, and the sink detecting the transitions in this signal.</p>
